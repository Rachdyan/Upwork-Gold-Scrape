# Introduction
In this project, I scraped gold market news headline from <a href = "https://www.reuters.com/news/archive/goldMktRpt?view=page&page=10&pageSize=10">reuters</a> and combine it with gold closing price data.
Then, I make a visualizations from the data such as frequency chart, wordcloud, time series plot, and pirate plot.


# Process
The process is split up into 4 md file:
- <b>scrape-news-data:</b> Scrape the news headlines from reuters website
- <b>combine-data:</b> Combine the existing gold price data with the headlines
- <b>news-data-eda:</b> analysis and visualizations of the news headlines
- <b>gold-price-eda:</b> analysis and visualizations of the gold prices

# Further Research
Several further research can be done to the data including sentiment analysis of the headlines and figuring out the relationship of the news headlines with the gold prices
